class _TaskScheduler(threading.Thread):
    """Private class to schedule tasks.

    Tasks added to the scheduler go through different stages.
    When a task is added, the scheduler will set it to
    `TaskStatus.SCHEDULED`. It will remain on this stage if a
    waiting time was given. This is useful to delay the execution
    of certain tasks. For example, those recurring tasks that
    overhead and stress some services.

    The scheduler will poll tasks to check their waiting times.
    Polling time can be configured using the attribute `polling`.

    Once waiting time is expired, the task will advance to the
    next stage. The scheduler generates one job for each task and
    enqueues it in some predefined worker queues. At this point,
    the task is set as `TaskStatus.ENQUEUED`.

    Task jobs will execute as soon as possible but it will depend
    on the overhead of the queues. These queues are created during
    the initialization of the class, giving a list of queues
    identifiers in the parameter `queues`.

    Task jobs execution is delegated to external workers. It is
    possible to bypass this behaviour, running tasks in the same
    thread. To do it, set `async_mode` to `False`.
